        <h3 class="judul1">Background Knowledge</h3>
        <p class="isi1">
          Propelled by an unwavering passion for technology, data analytics, and
          web development, I am deeply committed to expanding my expertise
          across the ever-evolving digital landscape. My academic foundation in
          Computer Science, coupled with extensive hands-on programming
          experience, has equipped me with the technical proficiency and
          analytical mindset necessary to explore intricate technological
          domains. I am particularly drawn to the dynamic fields of machine
          learning, software engineering, and technological research — areas
          that I believe hold immense potential for driving innovation and
          societal progress. This fascination fuels my relentless pursuit of
          knowledge, compelling me to engage in continuous learning and skill
          refinement. I thrive on challenges that demand creative
          problem-solving and strategic thinking, embracing each obstacle as an
          opportunity to uncover innovative solutions. By combining my technical
          skills with a mindset of curiosity and adaptability, I am dedicated to
          crafting impactful digital solutions that address real-world problems,
          enhance user experiences, and contribute positively to the broader
          community. Guided by a firm belief that meaningful progress stems from
          both technical expertise and a deep understanding of user needs, I
          remain committed to pushing boundaries, refining my craft, and
          ultimately contributing to technological advancements that leave a
          lasting and positive impact on society.

        <h3 class="judul2">My Opinion About Studies</h3>
        <p class="isi2">
          I perceive research as a compelling yet demanding pursuit — one that
          extends far beyond merely gathering data or conducting experiments. To
          me, research is a journey of uncovering insights, addressing
          real-world challenges, and contributing meaningful knowledge. I
          understand that this path often requires resilience and unwavering
          patience, as outcomes don’t always align with initial expectations.
          However, I view every setback as an invaluable opportunity for growth
          and deeper understanding. For me, research isn’t solely about reaching
          conclusions; it's about the process — formulating thoughtful
          questions, exploring diverse perspectives, and challenging established
          ideas. Despite its complexities, I believe that even the smallest
          steps forward have the potential to create meaningful impact.

        <h3 class="judul3">My Hobbies</h3>
        <p class="isi3">
          I find immense fulfillment in activities that challenge both my body
          and mind, particularly hiking and running. For me, these pursuits
          transcend mere physical exertion; they are deeply enriching
          experiences that foster resilience, clarity, and a profound connection
          with my surroundings. Hiking offers me a unique sense of liberation —
          each step on rugged trails feels like a quiet dialogue with nature,
          where every ascent demands focus and perseverance. Reaching the summit
          is not just about conquering heights, but about embracing the journey
          — the fatigue, the determination, and the moments of reflection along
          the way. Running, on the other hand, is where I find rhythm and
          balance. It’s not just a test of endurance; it’s a mental reset — a
          chance to clear my thoughts, break free from stress, and push my
          limits one stride at a time. Both activities serve as reminders that
          progress is often gradual, but with consistency and dedication, every
          step forward brings a sense of accomplishment and growth. Whether
          navigating winding trails or pounding the pavement, I embrace the
          journey as an opportunity to strengthen not just my body, but my
          spirit as well.
